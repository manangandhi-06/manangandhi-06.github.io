The console is one of the first tools developers learn about. The console is the tool developers use when debugging their own applications. The [law of the instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument) states that it‚Äôs easy to develop overconfidence in a familiar tool.

> ‚ÄúI suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.‚Äù¬†-Maslow

The same idea can be applied to the console. In an ecosystem where tools, keyboard shortcuts, and API‚Äôs flow like milk and honey in the promised land, it‚Äôs hard to justify picking up a new hammer when your old one works just fine. Trust me on this one though, those prong thingies on the back of your hammer [aren‚Äôt just for ripping out nails](https://www.familyhandyman.com/tools/hammers-aren-t-just-for-nails-101-ways-to-use-a-rip-hammer/view-all/).

What follows are some of the simplest tricks I‚Äôve found for debugging in the console.

#### #1: Wrapping Arguments

If you wrap the argument passed into `console.log` in {}‚Äôs you‚Äôll output the data you‚Äôre logging in object form. The object will have a nice name to tell you what it was that you were trying to output.

Rather than seeing a whole bunch of objects with similar fields like id and name in your console like this:

You‚Äôll get the name of the variable in front of the data being printed like this:

#### #2: Copying Data to the Clipboard

You can copy data logged in the console to your computer‚Äôs clipboard. I find this useful when you want to manipulate an object in a REPL or pull out data you‚Äôre debugging.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yxRiSSUeqr7Z-HSK2iU_-Q.gif)

Right click next to the data you want to copy and select ‚ÄúStore as a global variable‚Äù. This will save the data as a variable in the console with a temporary name. (If it‚Äôs the first time you‚Äôre doing it in a console window it will be `temp1`.) Then you can use the `copy()` command putting in the name `temp1` as the argument. This copies the data stored to your clipboard which you can paste like you would anything else you copy.

It‚Äôs especially helpful when a database query won‚Äôt return data in a format that matches how your data is being manipulated on the frontend. You can show you how data is being mutated or transformed.

#### #3: Short Circuiting expressions

If you short circuit an expression with a `||` you can make refactoring code or adding in a debug statement a lot faster. This is particularly useful with one line fat arrow functions where you want to see what data you‚Äôre receiving as an argument.

```js
// THIS
someFunction = data => (
  <div>
    <Component data={data} />
  </div>
)
```

```js
// BECOMES...
someFunction = data => **console.log(data) ||** (

  <div>
    <Component data={data} />
  </div>
)
```

```js
// RATHER THAN...
someFunction = data => **{**
 **console.log(data)**
 **return** (
 <div>
 <Component data={data} />
 </div>
 )
**}**
```

You skip out on wrapping the whole function in curly braces and adding a return. This feels like it‚Äôs not that big a deal until you‚Äôre optimizing performance and do it a thousand times trying to figure out what egregious React sin you‚Äôve committed.

#### #4: Log, Error,¬†Warn

In addition to `console.log()`, the console has several other functions to print data into the console in different predefined formats. Among these are:

- `console.log()`

- `console.warn()`

- `console.error()`

#### #5: Custom formatting for console¬†output

You can do more than just implement the built-in formatting with `console.log`, `warn`, and `error`. You can play the role of artist where the console is your canvas!

Perhaps try printing a nice pill around output you want to emphasize:

Here‚Äôs that snippet:

You can also store CSS to use as styles in a variable to apply to output. You can punk your coworkers with a splash of rainbow to trail everything you output. If you want humungous rainbows following everything, try this:

#### #6: Printing JSON as a¬†Table

Unbeknownst to many, the console has a built-in method for printing tabular data in table format. This can be great for quickly perusing JSON data.

#### #7: Easy¬†Counting

The `console.count()` method can make keeping track of how many times you‚Äôve hit a point in your code really simple. You no longer need to pepper your code in incrementing variables.

> Pro tip: you can replace ‚Äúnumber‚Äù with a label from a variable and it will count how many times the count method with that label has been hit.

I‚Äôve found this to be useful when trying to debug race conditions or unnecessary re-rendering in a React app.

#### #8: Using DOM¬†Elements

You can select a DOM element in the Elements tab and then access it with `$0`. The browser will actually keep a history where `$0` represents the current selection. `$1` represents the previous selection. `$2` the second last selection and so on up to 5 elements.

You may ask yourself: when would I ever want to change the innerHTML of my app from the console? And the answer would be probably only when you want a really simple example GIF for a blog post. But this too has its use cases.

#### #9: The Debugger Statement

If you‚Äôve ever added a console.log, gone into the browser tools and added a breakpoint, to see what‚Äôs happening when it gets to that code, free yourself with the `debugger` statement.

If you add `debugger` on a line in your Javascript the browser will stop and open up the debugging tools and pause execution.

Shortcut!

Although it‚Äôs not a console feature, it‚Äôs a great thing to know. Logging information to the console isn‚Äôt as effective or efficient as the debugging tools built into browsers (like Chrome‚Äôs Sources tab or Firefox‚Äôs Debugger tab). To further improve your debugging, look into resources that dive into those tools.

However, the console remains a really quick and effective way to see application flow in apps where lots of different lifecycle methods and re-renders are firing and improving how you use them too will make you a better developer.
