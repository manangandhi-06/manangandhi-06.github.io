Like many people, I have no shortage of ideas for apps that donâ€™t genuinely need to exist. I tend to hold onto those ideas waiting for some imaginary occasion where free time is abundant and I can build all of them with no thought of income or expense. For me, oftentimes the hurdle to completing a side project isnâ€™t knowing **how** to do something, but finding the motivation and time to bring it to fruition.

Thatâ€™s why I set a goal to launch a side project in 10 days.

This post isnâ€™t about the advantages of building with a new technology I was unfamiliar with, or 7 things I learned while doing it. Rather, itâ€™s about my process of building a web app quickly, keeping irrelevant ideas from muddying my focus, and my tool belt to make it happen. The end result was [Card Surge](https://card.surge.sh/).

### Idea (1Â day)

I spend a lot of time designing and building sites, which means I also spend a lot of time poring over well-designed sites from popular brands. I almost inevitably open up the Chrome inspector to examine how styles are applied or elements are laid out, because I want to see what can quantify those designs as **good**.

Then I find myself building my own site and referring back to those examples. I repeat the process of opening up the inspector, tweaking their styles, adding my own styles, not getting it right, positioning everything `absolute` which still doesnâ€™t work, and eventually coming up with something reasonable.

Having found other design tools online like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), or [Hero Patterns](https://www.heropatterns.com/) that were valuable to me, I thought I could make something similar to fit my own interest. And so I set out to build a faster way to iterate over card UI.

I dug through existing tools and found that they looked kind of meh. They didnâ€™t make it easy to create a decent shadow (because sliders were often used for inputs that rarely needed to be tweaked more than a number or two), and there was no reference to designs that actually worked. I felt like that was ample validation for my idea.

### Design (2Â days)

You see cards in layouts everywhere: pricing pages, product pages, lists, and so on. They are a great way of grouping relevant information and also can stand out on the page with a drop shadow or outline. You can refer to some of these examples of how they can vary:

They can have drop shadows, borders on some sides and not others, hover styles, can vary in color, and you can even apply multiple shadows to a single element to create a more exponential gradient in the drop shadow.

I wanted my tool to help designers and developers create cards that looked like those. I figured it should look aesthetically pleasing and use cards itself to help demonstrate what can be done to make them shine ðŸ’Ž

I started shaping my ideas in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), kept myself from hyperfocusing on unimportant pieces that I could easily do later (like adding logos for brands, adding social icons, and so on) and ended up with this:

![[https://www.figma.com/file/Cav6jxGjiOSOJLaZrnWUtiG1/Cards](https://www.figma.com/file/Cav6jxGjiOSOJLaZrnWUtiG1/Cards)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WDr4WzVZNUjdCUkcHrLY6g.png)
[https://www.figma.com/file/Cav6jxGjiOSOJLaZrnWUtiG1/Cards](https://www.figma.com/file/Cav6jxGjiOSOJLaZrnWUtiG1/Cards)

I knew that I wanted several things in my end product:

1.  An editor to tweak styles that would update the UI live
2.  A slider that could rotate through nice, fresh examples
3.  A place to export the code by copying to the clipboard

Those 3 essentials made the design, along with other things like the content below it and how exactly Iâ€™d format the footers and headers Iâ€™d left unfinished. It wasnâ€™t entirely fleshed out, because I wanted to get started building before I got too carried away unnecessarily changing things that were probably fine as is.

### Development (7Â days)

I figured that the most time consuming piece would be actually writing the code for the app, and I wasnâ€™t wrong. There always seem to be issues to worry about that donâ€™t become a problem until youâ€™re in the code. Things pop up like proper UX with the form elements, design decisions that werenâ€™t thought out in initial designs, unsupported features by libraries you plan on using, or Twitter demanding your attention at the expense of your project. ðŸ˜‰

I bootstrapped the development process with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) because:

- I could build the interface using React
- Converting the site into a PWA would be as simple as adding a couple lines to a config file (see [this](https://twitter.com/gill_kyle/status/1019949271309725696) tweet)
- Hosting would be a breeze with just static files to deploy
- I could skip a lot of the initial boilerplate and start building the fun pieces right way
- Gatsby is just freaking cool ðŸ™Œ

I started from the [gatsby-default-starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) and built much of the functionality without problems. I implemented 3rd party libraries like [react-color](https://github.com/casesandberg/react-color) and [react-slick](https://github.com/akiran/react-slick) to remove the need to build complicated slider and color components.

During this time, I decided how to lay out content on other parts of the page that my designs hadnâ€™t included, and built those parts too. I took advantage of newer trends like CSS Grid that made responsive layouts much easier.

At one point, I realized that the diagonal divider Iâ€™d included in the layout of my app could be abstracted out and turned into an npm package other people could use. After building a simple component and publishing the package on npm, I realized that I was way off course from my original goals for finishing my project. It would take too much time, so I abandoned that venture (after appending it to my aforementioned list of unnecessary apps and projects to be completed at a later date, that is).

I used a GitHub [project](https://github.com/gillkyle/card-surge/projects/1) to keep track of some of the little things I wanted to get done that were lower priority, and eventually took some measures to add in [Gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) for Google Analytics, some metadata, and included icons for browsers, mobile devices, and the PWA manifest configurations.

### Deploy (~45Â minutes)

**â€¦and launch!**

Once I got to a point where my app worked and functioned as Iâ€™d designed and envisioned, I thought it still wasnâ€™t good enough. I imagined a portal where users could authenticate, save, and share styles theyâ€™d made, and then use the app as a reference to return to. I came to the conclusion that that wasnâ€™t my original intent, and decided to just wrap up what I had actually done. I could build on top of it if I had the motivation later or found that it was something people would actually use.

Getting past those inhibitions of uncertainty throughout were easy since I had a goal in my sights.

I finally realized that I could look at my hard work and appreciate a genuinely cool thing Iâ€™d made:

Being more or less complete, deploying it was next. Deployment was a really simple process. I didnâ€™t really want to dump money into a domain on a side project I might not care for much in a year or two. So I took advantage of how [Surge](http://surge.sh/) hosts your sites in the free tier and named it card surge, so all I needed to do was snag the card subdomain and I had a free branded domain at card.surge.sh ðŸ˜¬. I ran `gatsby build` and then `surge`, and my code was online and distributed across a CDN with automatic SSL.

I also love [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) too much to not use it, so I pointed my GitHub repo at a project on Netlify to automatically build any pull requests or commits to Master ([which](https://github.com/gillkyle/card-surge/pull/1) came in handy just a couple hours after launching when the first pull request came in).

Without a need for a backend, my site was up and I hadnâ€™t spent a cent.

I took some screenshots and recordings using [Kap](https://getkap.co/), wrote up a description, and posted Card Surge on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/card-surge).

### Looking back

Working fast and pushing towards a completion date (that I had looming on the calendar) was really rewarding. I had to simplify problems to what mattered and only address concerns that would actually interfere with finishing and launching by my end date.

If I find another project I realistically think I can complete in just a few weeks, Iâ€™ll definitely do another sprint like this.

Overcome whatever reservations you have to wrap up that side project youâ€™ve been waiting to finishâ€Šâ€”â€Šyou wonâ€™t regret it!
