If youâ€™re like me, you jump through a lot of hoops to get Sass or Less to cooperate with a project, just to make it easier to add some variable colors and expressions to the styles throughout your codebase.

A new feature of native CSS called Custom Properties can create reusable properties across stylesheets for you, without needing the preprocessor ðŸ™Œ In order to use them, prepend a `--` to the front of the variable name of your custom property and define it like normal:

```css
:root {
  --primary-theme-color: #fdab37; /* orange */
  --secondary-theme-color: #4275b0; /* blue */
  --thickness: 5px;
  --size: 125px;
  --border-radius-squareness: 1; /* a factor for scaling #'s */
}
```

Then access your custom properties using the var() function:

```css
.primary {
  color: var(--primary-theme-color); /* #FDAB37 */
}
.secondary {
  color: var(--secondary-theme-color); /* #4275B0 */
}
```

You can use them like normal in other use cases like with the calc() function, or include them as a fragment of another attribute:

```css
button {
  width: calc(var(--size) * 3);
  border-radius: calc(var(--size) / var(--border-radius-squareness));
  border: var(--thickness) solid rgba(255, 250, 255, 0.5);
}
```

Using the native CSS also offers some unique advantages compared to Sass or Less variables:

#### You can programmatically alter and manipulate your variables at run time with Javascript

Being able to change the variable values at run time means you can create a theming system with little effort. Assign colors based on variables you define from the start and update them with Javascript to see changes take effect across your whole page.

#### They cascade like other styles in CSS, ie you can define a custom property early in your file and override itÂ later

Cascading styles means you can define custom properties and then in certain cases change them to match a more specific subset of styles, like with a media query. If you want your mobile view to have smaller margins, you can define one `--margin` property that can be used for all margins, and is then overridden depending on the viewpoint.

#### You donâ€™t have to deal with all the issues that can be introduced by configuring a preprocessor

This tweet by [Dan Abramov](https://medium.com/u/a3a8af6addc1) generated some good discussion and brought up some good points on both sides of the whyâ€™s for preprocessors:

But as the tweet brings up, you can introduce other issues by adding another dependency to your project.

Check out this demo combining these ideas, demonstrating them with Custom Properties:

adjust the sliders to see the effect

If most of your usage of a preprocessor is variables, or you can live without the other fancy mix-ins and functions available in a CSS preprocessor, leave it aside. There are powerful features of a preprocessor that can save a lot of time and simplify the styles of someone that knows the inâ€™s and outâ€™s, but if you havenâ€™t ever delved into something like Less or Sass, sticking to the native CSS features could be enough to get the job done.

CSS custom properties are available in ([almost](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables)) all browsers, so donâ€™t wait to take advantage of them. It could save you a lot of headache!
